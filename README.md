# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task
The problem is creating a program that works as a custom printf function.

## Description
To keep it modular I created multiple functions that are desinged to handle the format specifier d, c, s, u, o, x, p.
After which I used a struct to hold them in a separate function to then call them in the my_printf function.
